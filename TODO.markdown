# TODO
## High priority
* Weights are ranged (5-5.5kg)
* Better weight pairing (5kg/11lb) so the units tie up
* Store recipes and shopping list in DB

## Medium priority
* Categorisation through scoring, rather than regex
* Add up identical items
* Link buttons to changing the state of the item in the DB
* Only return non-bought/have items

## Low priority
* Multiple open, not accordion
